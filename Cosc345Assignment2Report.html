<h2>Report 2 for COSC Team</h2>

<p> <strong>The GitHub repository where the project is held:</strong> </p>


<p> <a href="https://github.com/CTanner020/COSC345-Application-and-Emulator">https://github.com/CTanner020/COSC345-Application-and-Emulator</a> </p>


<p> <strong>How to open the project</strong> </p>

<p>
    Assignment 2 is contained in the file Assignment2Final.zip to use the project simply unzip the file and load the Assignment2Final project into NetBeans.
    Then run the project from there.
</p>
<p>
    The project contains the index.html which communicates only with the emulator. The JavaScript file for the emulator and appFunctions which contains the
    application code.
</p>

<p> <strong>Navigation </strong> </p>

<p>
    The first screen (with a red background) is the home screen. Click and hold the left mouse button drag the mouse to the right and release the button, to go
    to the day setting screen (blue background). Do the same downward to decrement the day of the month and upward to increment it. To navigate back to the
    home screen from the day screen preform the same action to the left. From the home screen do the same action to the left again to enter the month screen.
    The functionality is the same here, drag up to increment the months and down to decrement them.
	
</p>

<p>
    The project has been developed in NetBeans. The team feels most comfortable with this IDE as it is used in the papers Info 221 and 223. Therefore Hussain and
    Yousef have the most experience in using it. The libraries used are jQuery which can be obtained here <a href="https://jquery.com/">https://jquery.com/</a>
    and is maintained by the jQuery foundation and Json3 which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.javascriptoo.com/json3">http://www.javascriptoo.com/json3</a> 
	the author is Bestiejs (the original Json was popularized by Douglas Crockford). We have elected also to use just straight 
	JavaScript (with jQuery) over Dart, as there is a lot more information and tutorials for using the jQuery library in JavaScript than for Dart.
</p>
<p>
    The emulator/application development was performed primarily in Chrome. Chrome was used simply because it is the most common browser in the operating
    systems we are using, so it was a natural starting point. Hence Firebug was not used for debugging; the team has found the standard console/inspector in
    Chrome’s developer tools sufficient for debugging at this point.
</p>

   <p> <strong> Code validation was performed with the following tools</strong> </p>


<p>HTML W3 HTML validation (<a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a>)</p>



<p> CSS Validation with W3 CSS validator (<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a>)</p>


<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>


<p>
    The emulator and application have been tested on multiple browsers and operating systems. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge on Windows
    10, XP, MACSOX El Capitan and Linux. It has performed as intended on each of these platforms.
</p>
<p>
    The main problem with the application is more of a design flaw than a bug. When you click, drag and release the mouse in an up and down motion. If the
    angle between the click and the release is not quite straight, the application currently takes this as a swipe from left to right not as up and down which
    sends the user back to the home screen. This will be amended in the next version.
</p>
<p>
    Current progress on the application itself has been slower than anticipated, but it is being made. As it stands, the application can move between dates
    using mouse-click events, but no appointments can be made so far. This is due to a combination of our team’s lack of experience with JavaScript and
    everyone being pressed for time by other assignments. However, this is by no means a failure. What we currently have is an underlying structure that we can
    build on.
</p>
<p>
    We have changed one key feature from our original design. Rather than the buttons being placed around the canvas element window, as was the original plan,
    movement between “windows” and altering the day/month is achieved through mouse-click swipes (this emulates the swiping functionality of a smart watch).
    This may need to change before the final version of the application, since the mouse-click swipes may be a function of the browser and therefore need to be
    hidden by the emulator, but the functions themselves work for now and can easily be replaced at a later date. In testing the swiping navigation we
    currently have, the original back button design may not be necessary as navigation through swipes only feels more intuitive.
</p>

<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>

<p>
    First, the ability to change the week of the appointment needs to be resolved. This is more difficult because date objects do not have week functions built
    into them. Because of this, it may be necessary to remove this feature and simply adjust by day and month.
</p>
<p>
    Second, a way of saving appointments needs to be implemented. The challenge here is the ability to create objects that persist after the
    emulator/application is closed.
</p>
<p>
    Third, the aesthetics need work. As it stands, the application is plain-looking and unappealing. If we want people to use our app, we need something that
    looks better than it currently does. After this, all other features that we initially planned on (adjustable alert sounds, make appointments repeat etc.)
    can be added.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of a timeframe for these changes, our deadline is roughly the 12<sup>th</sup> of August. The break between semesters means that our group won’t
    have other University work, which gives us until July 11<sup>th</sup> to work uninterrupted.
</p>

 <p>Therefore the revised schedule is as follows</p>

<p>
    Creation of lasting/recurring events: 20<sup>th</sup> June
    <br/>
    Improved visuals: 27<sup>th</sup> June
    <br/>
    Other feature implementation: 11<sup>th</sup> July
    <br/>
    Debugging/other jobs: 12<sup>th</sup> August
