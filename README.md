# COSC345-Application-and-Emulator - Assignment 3
This is where we store files relevant to the Application and Emulator.

This branch contains only the necessary files to run the application and emulator, as well as relevant reports and testing scripts.
There are also two zip files, which separately contain the application files and the emulator files, for passing on to the other teams for part 4 of the assignment.
